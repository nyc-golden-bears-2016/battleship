# battleship

This is a fully functional battleship clone. It uses a Rails backend and an ERB (embeded ruby)/Javascript front-end to allow for real-time, non-local play between players. 

Setup: 

`git clone https://github.com/nyc-golden-bears-2016/battleship.git`
`cd battleship`
`bundle install`
`rails db:create`
`rails db:migrate`
`rails s`

Then go to localhost:3000 in your browser and create a new player!

tip: if you'd like to play locally, use two different browsers (ex. Firefox and Chrome) for either player. If you use one browser, the player cookie will be the same across all tabs. 

Thanks and enjoy!
